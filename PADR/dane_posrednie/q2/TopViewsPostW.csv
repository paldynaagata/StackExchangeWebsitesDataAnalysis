<p>(Added note: This is a worldbuilding question in that the desired law-free environment would practically be an isolated ""world"" with its own conditions, and this is a question about the backstory and conditions needed for it to be plausible. i.e. Suppose someone wanted to create a new environment by starting a new pocket dictatorship on an uninhabited island, or even a single ship, barge, or set of vessels, on 21st Century Earth. What set of laws and dangers would they need to work around?)</p>

<p>I know just traveling into international waters is insufficient to avoid prosecution, since your boat will likely be registered in the US and thus subject to US law.  Are there any other loopholes to work with this to make it legal though?  I have a few examples in mind, but I'm mainly asking for any way one could exploit international waters.</p>

<ol>
<li>If I have my own boat and I use it to travel to international waters without officially registering it in the US would I no longer be subject to US laws? </li>
<li>If I travel by boat to some tiny no-name uninhabited island that is outside of any countries boundaries and commit my crime there is it legal?  If so how far would I have to travel to get to such an island realistically (ie, are there islands not claimed by anyone that aren't in the middle of the Atlantic)?</li>
<li>If I claimed some tiny no-name Island could I declare myself to be an independent country with my own laws?  Then could I register boats with my own country and have them travel to various countries?  Effectively could I have a ""anything legal for a price"" service where anyone could pay to be picked up by my boat and take into international waters to do questionable things without it being illegal, since only my very lax laws would officially apply?</li>
</ol>

<p>Finally, if someone uses one of the above loopholes to commit a crime and comes back to the US, admitting to what he did, what could legally be done?  For instance if I murder someone in international waters I likely can still be arrested for premeditating murder, even if I'm not arrested for the actual murder, since I planned it in the US.  However, if I commit a crime like gambling, or marrying my favorite barnyard animal, or 'relations' with some 15 year old girlfriend, which doesn't have laws against premeditation would I be free even if I fully admitted and advertised my actions later?</p>

6411,1,6414,"2014-12-12T16:08:48.083",65874,"<p>I always get very annoyed if a writer is sloppy with maps and travel-distances.<br>
E.g. ""They left city Y and arrived in city X 5 days later."" When you look at the supplied map Y and X are a 1600 kilometers apart. Must have been really special horses.</p>

<p>So I like to avoid doing the same. Problem is that I don't know much about long-distance traveling by horse. And finding info on the Internet is very hard or my Google-Fu is failing completely on this one: All I can find is enduro-racing for horses and speed-records for horses. Neither of which is relevant for my problem.</p>

<p>To get to the actual questions, first some background:<br>
For a story in a Fantasy setting (late Medieval/early Renaissance world) I have a group of 8 people traveling by horse. The travel is going to take them 6 weeks. This duration is a given to make several parallel time-lines match up in the story. I like to keep the traveling as realistic as possible. Presume earth-like conditions.  </p>

<p>Travel is subject to the following constraints:  </p>

<ul>
<li>This is the only ""magic/fantasy"" aspect: The rider and his/her horse are magically bonded. This means the horse and rider can't be separated by more than a kilometer. The horse can't be abused or ridden to death: this would mentally unbalance the rider. So the horses need to survive the journey and arrive in reasonable condition. Each rider needs to ride his/her own horse. Due to the bond riding a different horse is impossible.</li>
<li>The riders and horses are accustomed to prolonged long-distance travel, but the horses are not specifically bred for this. They are high-quality riding horses, but not physically exceptional in any way.</li>
<li>Riders travel light (couple of saddle-bags, blanket). Majority of luggage, armor, food-supplies and camping gear goes on the pack-horse(s). Pack-horses can be replaced as needed. At most 1 pack-horse per rider.</li>
<li>Assume travel in summer in temperate climate. 20-25 Celsius during the day. At night at least 10 Celsius. About 18 hours of daylight. Weather is mostly dry, with the occasional light rain or maybe a short thunderstorm.</li>
<li>The party will often <del>usually</del> camp at night in the open. Horses will be able to find sufficient feed and water. <em>At least</em> every 4th or 5th day the party will encounter a village or town with an inn or a caravanserai so they can spend the night in comfort. In such places they can also buy supplies and pack-horses. A farrier is available in such places too.<br>
(<em>This item is slightly edited to clarify that an inn is less frequent than camping, but there wont be more than 5 days between inns.</em>)</li>
<li>Terrain is mostly flat or gently rolling plains. Some hills, but they are not steep. Woodlands, prairie, pastures and fields near villages/towns. The roads consist of hard-packed dirt or a dirt-gravel mix and are in decent condition. After rain they will dry out quickly so one can presume the travelers won't have to deal with heavy suction mud.</li>
</ul>

<p>Now for the actual questions:</p>

<ol>
<li>How much distance can I expect the party to cover on average per day? (Bear in mind they will have to travel continuously for 6 weeks.) I can add a few resting days if needed for the benefit of the horses.<br>
I have a great deal of leeway with the map (like adding an inland sea or impassable mountain range) so I can easily make the route match up to the kilometers required.</li>
<li>What would the typical traveling-day look like? I have no idea how fast the horses would actually go. How many resting-breaks would be needed during the day? How long would those have to be?</li>
</ol>

<p>I'm hoping for some enlightenment on the subject so I can construct a convincing ""travel-blog"" for this story.</p>

<p>Both worked perfectly fine. Now, he received a third gift from a magician.<br>
Immortality.</p>

<p>My hero was told, that the immortality works like this:</p>

<ul>
<li>The only thing that can actually kill you, is getting your head cut off completely or starve to death.</li>
<li>Other injuries will still hurt, but everything else will recover itself without the need for surgery.</li>
<li>To recover, your body will need extra energy to heal. So if you are hurt, you have to eat and drink like crazy.</li>
<li>Basically the immortality works on the principle of ""quick flawless regeneration"". Each cell in your body is regenerated perfectly without any pesky side effects, aging included.</li>
<li>You cannot drown or suffocate. However, your body will need extra energy to work under water or in unbreathable gasses. </li>
<li>Extra objects inserted to your body (like bullets or daggers) will be absorbed by your body eventually. And yes, that's extra energy cost.</li>
<li>You cannot get fat. If you eat too much, your body temperature will increase to get rid of the excess energy.</li>
<li>The magician will check your progress in life after 250 years.</li>
</ul>

<p>As you can guess, the magician disappeared after telling my hero these basics.</p>

<p>My hero is a 30 year old male, who never had any type of operation which leaves something in the body (like hip replacement or a bone fracture, which needs screws to hold the bone together).</p>

<p>He tried to cut himself and it hurt as usual. The scar seems to be healing quicker than my hero is used to.</p>

<p>My hero still does not believe in magic. Also he does not trust this magician. However, if he is really immortal, he can make some really long term plans.</p>

<p>So, how to test if you are immortal? Yes, you can put a dagger to your heart ... but if the magician was lying (or immortality simply does not exist) that would be a really stupid test...</p>

He has a very important message: [horrible thing] is about to happen soon, and he wants to warn us so we can avoid/prevent it.  (Yes, this assumes a model in which ""paradoxical causality"" is not an issue.)  The problem is if he goes around saying ""I'm a time traveler from the future,"" no one's gonna believe him.  They'd dismiss him as a crackpot.</p>

<p>So, he brings along proof, in the form of...?</p>

<p>This is actually a pretty tricky question, if we place two restrictions on it:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>He does not have a ""time machine"".  His device sent him back without coming along with him, so he has no way to demonstrate that he's a time traveler by actually <em>demonstrating time travel</em>.  (Just as an aside, this is very much on purpose; he doesn't want knowledge of the mechanics of time travel to fall into the hands of people who might <a href=""http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MakeWrongWhatOnceWentRight"">use it for nefarious purposes</a>, and part of his plan is to actively sabotage scientific research that led to the development of time travel.)  The thing he used--let's just call it a ""time catapult""--was able to send a small payload back in time, maybe comparable volume to <a href=""http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0096928/"">a phone booth</a>, certainly quite a bit less than <a href=""http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0088763/"">the interior of a car</a>.</p></li>
<li><p>He wants to get the issue of establishing proof of identity over with and out of the way as quickly as possible and move on to more important things, like averting future disasters.  This is a real issue; he can't go back arbitrarily far in time; the Temporal Frobulence Theorem shows that it becomes extremely unsafe the further back you go; it's a bit of a stretch even to reach our time!</p></li>
</ol>

<p>The two obvious candidates for proof are <strong>future technology</strong> and <strong>knowledge of future events</strong>. The first is tricky, because current technological advancement puts us perilously close to the boundaries of Clarke's 3rd Law: any sufficiently advanced technology is likely to not be easily recognizable as such, and anything <em>insufficiently advanced</em> would be likely to just look like someone working in his garage made a breakthrough in some field, and that's pretty cool and all, but obviously it doesn't prove he's from the future.</p>

<p>The second is also kind of tricky.  There are two major classes of unpredictable future events: natural and manmade.  Bringing official government records of earthquakes, hurricanes, etc. could certainly establish that he is who he says he is, but it would take a lot of valuable time for Mother Nature to furnish the proof.  On the other hand, if he predicts unpredictable manmade events, there are all sorts of potential troubles there.  Point out the time and place of a major crime?  Obviously, he was in on it; let's arrest him!  Produce a table of stock market closing values for the next month?  Well, he might be right for a day or two (coincidentally, of course!), but as soon as someone starts using the data he provides and attempting to profit by making trades based on it, the Butterfly Effect flutters in and destroys the accuracy of the data.</p>

<p>So, what would be the quickest, most efficient way for our unfortunate herald to establish beyond reasonable doubt that he is a time traveler with accurate knowledge of future events, and at the same time get enough people to listen to him so he can spread his doomsday message?</p>
