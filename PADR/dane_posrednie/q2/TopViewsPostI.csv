Understandably, my wife is envious of the relationship and even sometimes suspects it is more than a platonic friendship (at least emotionally). </p>

<p><strong><em>How can I convince her that the relationship is platonic without changing the nature of the friendship?</em></strong></p>

<p>Here are the critical, key points:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Me and 'Katie' (fictional name for my friend, for future reference only) met at a wrestling class. This is an intimate sport with a lot of closes, physical contact. We both love the sport and we train together 3 times per week (in a class situation) and then 1 on 1 alone once a week.</p></li>
<li><p>We meet up once a week for a non-wrestling related day. We usually do another activity just for fun and then go out for food or just hang out somewhere for the day.</p></li>
<li><p>We have a holiday booked for 1 week. It is a training camp and we are sharing a room, but it is a twin room.</p></li>
<li><p>We speak on the phone (via a texting app) on average 2 - 3 times per day. I would say we exchange an average of 20 - 50 messages per day. We always send one to each other last thing at night.</p></li>
<li><p>When we have been apart, we have told each other how we miss each other and have exchanged mutual feelings of loving each others company, loving being friends etc. She has also said if I am down or look sad that it makes her feel the same way.</p></li>
<li><p>Understandably, the above makes it look like there is something more than friendship potentially. But here is the thing. We are both married. She has said she is happily married and has 4 children with her husband. But she has also said that he is happy with our friendship and that she wants us to be friends forever. She said that since knowing me, she has been much happier in general.</p></li>
<li><p>I don't know if this has any relevance but I thought I would include it anyway that I was recently diagnosed with Autism. But I don't personally agree with that and also I have a job etc and friends so I am pretty 'normal' even if it is correct.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>The friendship has dramatically improved my happiness levels. Having such a close friend is amazing, and I want to keep that, while still keeping my partner happy and comfortable also.</p>

<p>I have spoken to my wife about the friend and she said she won't stop me seeing her but that she is very jealous of it and doesn't like it. </p>

I make about ten times what my boyfriend does. He's also a professional and makes good money himself. We've discussed money before but I've always just avoided the subject. </p>

<p>He often offers to pay for things and I try to go halfsies with him because I feel bad, but he sometimes insists because he's the guy. </p>

<p>We've been dating for three months now and I don't like hiding things from him. Like this week I did contract renegotiations with clients and it was stressing me out and it went so well and I couldn't explain all the details why I just had to be really vague.</p>

<p>My biggest fear is that this will change things.</p>

<ul>
<li>What if he treats me differently?  </li>
<li>What if he doesn't like that I earn more than he does?  ""Guys must look after girls"" and all that.</li>

<p>I know that I'm probably over reacting to this and it'll probably be fine but I am really stressed about telling him about this and how it will go and if it's the right time. I don't want to make a big deal of it either, I just want him to know and then we go back to normal. How do I do that?</p>

2699,1,2718,"2017-08-28T00:28:31.383",47070,"<h2>Situation</h2>

<p>I'm German, in my mid-20s and currently living together with my girlfriend without kids. I earn a fairly good salary for my age compared to other family members and was always a saver (cheap car, no expensive vacations, ...) to fulfil my <strong>ultimate</strong> life goal of buying a house (real estate) for myself. Recently I also inherited some money which I of course also want to spend on my house.</p>

<p>Sadly, some of my (close) family members (like my sister/her husband and partly my mother) can't handle their own money/income that well (at least this is my impression, of course, this view is biased). They spend money on stuff that I never would spend so much money on (e.g. leisure time, amusement parks, vacation together with their kids). It is also not that they are poor. They have a very good double income.</p>

<p>Regularly they ask me for a loan to pay their stuff <em>because they can't</em>. The amount of money they owe me is getting higher and higher. Of course, I want to help my family in critical life situations, but not to let them live their dream life while I lose money to invest into my future house. If I try to say no, they come up with sentences like:</p>

<ul>
<li>We <em>need</em> that new car because we both have jobs (one of the parents could easily travel by bike)</li>
<li>Get old enough to have kids, then you will understand</li>
<li>You don't even need your own money</li>
<li>We need a cleaning lady because I can't handle it alone</li>
</ul>

<p>Eventually, I'm giving them the loan because I don't want to be seen as a complete mug.</p>

<p>In some bigger cases, I have a valid, written contract. For smaller amounts, I usually said to them to add this to the final volume of the money lent. They started paying back but stopped quietly (!) doing so for some months until I asked them to start paying again (and they did). I could have cancelled the contract (because there's a clause for this case), but eventually I didn't. </p>

<p>They have interest rates, far lower than from a bank and also including an agreement for regular payments, which they have not fulfilled all the time. Because they didn't, the interest rate being so low caused the whole loan to be a negative game for me because of inflation. I am in no way wealthy, I just have above-average savings and earnings which I currently don't spend to save on my life goal.</p>

<p>Finally, this pattern of behavior has set a bad example for my nephew: he is now asking me for a loan. His own mother can't lend him any money because the next vacation is already booked.</p>

<h2>Question</h2>

<p>How to avoid being seen as a cash cow in my family without being seen as a grasping and unhelpful person? My goal is to not give them any more money in the future.</p>

<hr>

<p><em>A thing I always ask myself is whether the problem I have is really on my own side and it should be okay for family members to ask for money even for non-critical stuff.</em></p>

<p><strong>Responses to comments</strong></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Did you get anything written down? Or does the exact amount and even the fact that they did loan any money at all come down to your and their memory (or conscience)?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In some bigger cases I have a valid, written contract. For smaller amounts I ususally said to them to add this to the final volume of the lent money.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Are they actually paying back any of the ""loans""? How much total money do they owe you? €5k 10k 20k?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yes and no. They started paying back but stopped quietly doing so for some months until I asked them to start paying again (and they did). I could have cancelled the contract (because there's a clause for this case), but eventually I didn't. The total money lent is more than 10k.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Are those loans with agreed interest and regular payments, or just ""pay me back when you can""?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>They have interest rates, far lower than on a bank and also regular payments, which they did not fullfil all the time. Because they didn't, the interest rate so low caused the whole loan to be a negative game for me because of inflation.</p>

3658,1,3720,"2017-09-10T08:33:17.673",44919,"<p>When I went to live with my girlfriend a few years ago I was initially surprised by how she got very angry (using a very aggressive tone, shouting, ecc..) when I did ""something wrong"". By angry, I mean that she might use a very aggressive tone and shout with rant lasting several minutes. She never got physically aggressive or anything of that sort.</p>

<p>Just to give you some examples of the things that could make her angry were me saying some inappropriate jokes, the fact that I was frequently late or the fact that I was frequently a bit absent-minded or absorbed in other things.</p>

<p>While recognizing my mistakes, I made her notice that her reactions were somehow excessive and we reached the conclusion that I should be more careful around here in some contexts and at the same time that she should take better care of her behavior when annoyed or angry.</p>

<p>After a few years, now the situation is kind of different. I think I really improved with her and I am much now more careful, she also completely recognizes this. Unfortunately, at the same time, she worsened her behavior. She still gets angry, but now over smaller and smaller issues. Also, while at first, it happened mainly when we were alone, now she's doing this when other people are around, even friends or relatives, making it even more painful and embarrassing. </p>

<p>I never got so irrationally angry at her and never shouted at her in any way. When she gets angry and starts shouting I generally just shut up until she's over and then tell her that she went mental again. She generally answers at first by trying to justify herself in some way and then by recognizing that I'm right and the issue at hand was ridiculous (or sometimes even non-existent!) and by saying she's sorry and will be more careful in the future. Unfortunately, after a just a few days, we are again dealing with the same situation.</p>

<p>I think it's important to add that she doesn't behave in this way with her friends or acquaintances, while she does instead something similar with her parents. I think it's also valuable to say that she told me that her parents used to fight in this way quite frequently, especially when she was a child.</p>

<p>I tried to talk to her about the reasons behind her behavior, to try to understand if she just got really angry over nothing or she just has excessive reactions when she is just slightly annoyed and she seems to be more inclined to believe the latter. As a solution, I really tried to talk to her about this a lot and even suggested that she could visit a specialist (something she is now considering).</p>

<p>Is there any other thing I could do to make her improve her behavior?  </p>

<p><strong>EDIT, a few details I added in the comments:</strong></p>

<p><strong>An example of how she may get angry over a small thing:</strong></p>

<p>She may be looking at something funny on the web and asks me to join her. While doing it together it may come to my mind something related that I'm sure she may appreciates and I suggest her to search for that. Maybe she doesn't do that immediately (and that's fine of course) so after a few minutes I suggest it again and she flies off the handle. She may start to scream about how she wants to look at what she prefers, how she wants to be left alone, that she has already wasted too much time doing nothing, that she already had a very tough day and I'm only making it worse, and similar things.</p>

<p><strong>About her childhood:</strong></p>

<p>She had a very good childhood, in a upper-middle class family where she was treated like a princess. Her parents are a very strong couple, very close together. They just happened to share a lot of time together (both worked from home) and when some conflict arose they reacted by raising their voices, but AFAIK never insulting each others or worse.</p>

<p>She and I have always loved video games, we both own several consoles (PS4, Nintendo DS, Nintendo Switch etc), we actually met online on one of the official communities of one of these consoles.</p>

<p>She never played video games excessively, for instance, after no more than few hours she always stopped playing for the day.</p>

<p>It's already been a few months since she started playing one of those pay-to-win games on mobile (games where you are supposed to buy additional in-game items to proceed with the game), it's called Final Fantasy XV: A New Empire, and it's basically a Travian-like game, where you have your own village, you can add new buildings, upgrade them, attack others, and have a guild.</p>

<p>The game has some pretty expensive add-ins, the average price is around 100 dollars, but they can go up to 200 or more. The minimum is usually 20 dollars or so.</p>

<p>So far she bought just 25 or so dollars worth of add-ins and that's not a problem to me, even if I don't agree with spending money in such a dumb and worthless game.</p>

<p>The problem is that (I guess), not spending as much as her other friends on the game to buy speed-ups and make the game easier to progress. She plays this game from the morning to late night continuously, she doesn't work so she plays all day.</p>

<p>Even when we hang out together for some romantic time in restaurants and so on she always has the smartphone with her, with the game on.</p>

<p>I thought to give her an ultimatum of the kind ""stop with this game or I quit"", but knowing her she wouldn't accept this and she'd only get upset and probably leave.</p>

<p>I tried to get involved in the situation to help her make the game easier, I set up a bot for her to automate some extremely time-consuming actions, but it didn't help.</p>

<p>She is a really sweet girl, but I never considered her more than a friend. I would like to tell her ""No"", without ruining our friendship. She really supports me and helps me in making decisions. Also, her sister has just moved out of the house so she seems a little sad. Yesterday, she brought up the topic again and asked me what my answer was. I wanted to tell her ""No"" but just don't want to hurt her feelings. </p>

<p>How do I explain this to her without her getting hurt/our friendship getting ruined? </p>

<p>EDIT:
She also expects a reason why I am rejecting her (if my answer is NO which it is)?!</p>

<p>UPDATE:
Everything went well. I moved to another country after a few months. I told her that she's a great person and I hope she understands that I have other things to do in life and I am not ready for a relationship. Also I told her that we're friends now and will always be. I told her that there is no guarantee that if we get into a relationship, that it will go on forever. But this will go on forever. Its best if things stay the way they are. I also said, I have a great deal of respect for her and she'll always be a special person in my life. She was kind and gracious enough to understand. It's been eight months and we're still great friends. Thanks for all the advice!</p>
