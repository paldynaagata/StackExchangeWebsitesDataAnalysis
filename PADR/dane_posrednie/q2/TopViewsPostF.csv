<p>If there is any effect, then is the effect and quantity of effect is same for masturbation and sex or they are different.(Because I'm more concerned about masturbation here, and not sex).</p>

5032,1,5038,"2012-01-04T19:36:04.573",199298,"<p>This is going to sound like a stupid question. I apologize. But I've had it on my mind for a while and it needed to be asked.</p>

<p>My question is: <b>how do you use the shower at the locker room at the gym?</b></p>

<p>I told you it was stupid.</p>

<p>But really, I've had gym memberships for a total of about 5 years during my life (not consecutive). I've gone frequently and worked out, but I've never used the showers there. Why not? Honestly, I've just been too nervous about it. It's not so much public nudity itself that makes me nervous. It does make me feel weird and a little self conscious to take my clothes off in a room with other people in it, but I don't think other people really care that much. What <em>does</em> worry me though is the possibility of committing some kind of social faux pas or perhaps even exposing myself to some kind of safety hazard.</p>

<p>Some of the things that have run through my mind as I contemplate taking a shower at the gym: </p>

<ul>
<li>Where do I keep my clothes? </li>
<li>If in a locker, should I wear a towel between the shower and the locker?</li>
<li>Where do I keep the <em>towel</em> while I'm in the shower? Not every place I've been to has somewhere to hang it.</li>
<li>If there are no private showers, is it normal to shower in a bathing suit or similar attire? My current gym has private shower stalls with curtains, but I've been to gyms where the showers were more community style.</li>
<li>Where do I keep my cell phone/wallet/keys? I can't really bring them with me into the shower, so I suppose I'd have to keep them in the locker. But is that safe? If someone broke into my locker while I was in the shower, I'd lose everything valuable <em>and</em> I'd have no clothes.</li>
<li>If I use a shower that strangers have used, are there any possible health repercussions? Do I need to wear sandals to protect against athlete's foot, for example?</li>
<li>Is it normal/OK to perform other grooming functions, such as shaving, or brushing your teeth, in a gym locker room?</li>
<li>Etc</li>
</ul>

<p>So again, in summary, <b>what is the safest and most socially acceptable way to use a locker room at the gym?</b></p>

<p>It does surprise me how anxious I feel about this, considering I'm usually pretty laid back about most things. I have been to the hot springs and even bath houses in Japan, when I was there visiting friends. But I felt less anxious about that because I was accompanying people who knew what they were doing, and I just did my best to imitate them. When I go to the gym locker room by myself I feel completely out-of-sorts. I feel like everybody else in the world has read some secret manual about how to deal with this and nobody ever handed me a copy. Please help!</p>

<p>If there's some cultural ambiguity about social customs, please assume for the purposes of this question that we're talking about the United States.</p>

3660,1,3662,"2011-09-02T17:40:56.557",136550,"<p>Over the last 2 months or so of doing heavy squats (200 lbs - 262 lbs) I've frequently had pain in my knees. During the last 2 weeks, it's been especially persistent and seems to be mostly in my left knee. I'm normally sore after working out, especially in my legs and lower back, but the knee pain seems to persist long after the other pains go away.</p>

<p>What does it feel like? Well, it's on the front side of the leg, centered just below the knee cap. By ""below"" I mean ""in the direction of my foot"", not ""closer to the bone"". It's hard to describe the sensation exactly. It's kind of a pulling/burning feeling. It feels somewhat different than muscle soreness elsewhere, but I don't feel like anything's grinding or scraping or popping. It's not a ""sharp"" pain.</p>

<p>As far as intensity goes, it's not excruciating. Actually it's mild enough that I feel that I could ignore it when doing my squats and continue performing my workouts as planned. I'm just not sure that's a good idea. It is bad enough though that running for more than a minutes or so is a very unpleasant idea.</p>

<p>I do not feel any pain when standing, sitting, or walking. I <em>do</em> feel it whenever I ascend/descend at all. Getting up from a chair, walking up or down a flight of stairs, and of course when doing squats. I also feel it when running.</p>

<p>I've tried skipping a couple workouts, and although the pain seems to gradually get better with time, 5-6 days is not enough to get rid of it, and it comes right back when I resume my workouts. I had been more or less ignoring it for the last month or so, but since it's now preventing me from running, I'm getting more concerned.</p>

<p>I have also tried using a foam roller on the muscles surrounding my knee (but avoiding the knee itself). This seemed to help with some other pains/soreness I'd had, but not with the knee pain.</p>

<p>I'm 95% sure the pain is caused by my squatting. It always gets worse during/after I squat. I squat just below parallel, with a shoulder-width stance and my feet pointing outwards about 15 degrees. I try to keep my knees following that 15 degree direction, pointing in the direction of my feet, when I descend. Historically I've done 5 sets of 5 reps, but more recently I've been doing 3 sets of 5. I rest about 5 minutes in between sets.</p>

<p><b>So, should I be concerned about this, if so how should I handle it?</b> Is it likely that I'm doing something wrong? Should I take a couple weeks off from squatting and running? Ignore it and keep going? Deload significantly and work back up so my body adapts more? See a doctor? I know you are (probably) not a doctor and not qualified to give medical advice. I'm just hoping to find out if this (1) ignorable, (2) a concern, but something that can be solved with a period of rest and/or dealoading or (3) a big problem I'll need professional help with.</p>

<p><br /><h2>Update 2011-09-09</h2><br /></p>

<p>Update: I saw an osteopathic doctor yesterday. He told me my tendons and ligaments were fine. In fact he said ""your ligaments look like they're built to take a lot of punishment!"". He diagnosed <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patellofemoral_pain_syndrome"">patellofemoral pain syndrome</a> AKA ""runners knee"". He told me the inside of my knee cap had become rough. He prescribed R.I.C.E (Rest, Ice, Compression, Elevation) as well as a twice-daily stretching regimen, and weighted leg extensions 3 times a week. He also suggested I take ibuprofin, especially if I'm doing anything to aggravate my knees. He told me recovery could take 6 weeks or more, but call him if I didn't see a significant difference by the end of the month.</p>

<p>So at this point I'm going to follow the routine the doctor gave me for the next 6 weeks or so, and avoid squats, deadlifts, and running. I will continue doing the other exercises I'd been doing (bench press, overhead press, rows, and pull-ups). I may also try swimming if I feel like doing cardio (but I'm a terrible swimmer). After I feel I've recovered I'll start squats with about 50% of the weight I was last doing (262 lbs was my peak work weight) and I'll work my way back up. I'll have someone check my form then too.</p>

<p>Thanks for the answers. They helped me to realize that this wasn't something I should ignore, and that my squat form was likely at fault. I'm marking Dave's answer as ""most helpful"" for the strong suggestion to see a doctor, which I did. But I also really appreciate Berin Loritsch's answer for the form tips and the TUBOW suggestion especially. </p>

11698,1,11705,"2013-02-18T23:21:37.167",131816,"<p>At the gym, some of the equipment doesn't have the weight listed on the individual weight plates, just numbers.
